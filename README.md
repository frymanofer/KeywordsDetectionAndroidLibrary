## About this package:

This is a **"wake word"** package for React Native. A wake word is a keyword that activates your device, like "Hey Siri" or "OK Google".

It also provide **Speech to Intent**. **Speech to Intent** refers to the ability to recognize a spoken word or phrase
and directly associate it with a specific action or operation within an application. Unlike a **"wake word"**, which typically serves to activate or wake up the application,
Speech to Intent goes further by enabling complex interactions and functionalities based on the recognized intent behind the speech.

For example, a wake word like "Hey App" might activate the application, while Speech
to Intent could process a phrase like "Play my favorite song" or "Order a coffee" to
execute corresponding tasks within the app.
Speech to Intent is often triggered after a wake word activates the app, making it a key
component of more advanced voice-controlled applications. This layered approach allows for
seamless and intuitive voice-driven user experiences.
